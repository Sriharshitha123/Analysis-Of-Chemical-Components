## 🧴 Cosmetic Product Recommendation System 🧴

Welcome to the Cosmetic Product Recommendation System! This project aims to simplify the selection process for skincare products by leveraging data science techniques to create personalized recommendations based on the chemical components of various cosmetics. 🌟

## 📚 Overview

In the ever-expanding world of cosmetics, finding the right product for one's skin type, especially for sensitive skin, can be overwhelming. Our system analyzes the chemical ingredients in cosmetics to predict which products are most suitable for individual users, enhancing their shopping experience and ensuring better skin health. 💄✨

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathered a comprehensive dataset of 1,472 cosmetic products from Sephora, focusing on moisturizers suitable for dry skin. Ensured data quality through meticulous cleaning processes. 🧼📊
- **Ingredient Analysis**: Tokenized and encoded ingredient lists to create a binary document-term matrix, representing the presence of each ingredient in products. 🧬🔍
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Employed t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to visualize high-dimensional ingredient data in 2D space, uncovering patterns and similarities between products. 📉📈
- **Interactive Visualization**: Created an interactive dashboard using Bokeh, allowing users to explore relationships between products based on their chemical components. Users can hover over data points to view detailed product information. 📊🖱️
- **Recommendation System**: Developed a content-based recommendation system to provide personalized product suggestions, reducing the guesswork in selecting skincare items. 💡🛍️

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Enhance Consumer Decision-Making**: Assist users in choosing products that suit their skin type, particularly for sensitive or dry skin, by providing clear, data-driven recommendations. 🧑‍🔬🔍
2. **Leverage Data Science Techniques**: Utilize advanced methodologies, including word embedding and t-SNE, to process and analyze large sets of cosmetic ingredient data. 🧠📊
3. **Create Interactive Visualizations**: Develop engaging and user-friendly tools that help users intuitively explore and compare cosmetic products. 🎨🖥️
4. **Improve Market Insights**: Provide actionable insights for cosmetic companies, aiding in better product development and more informed purchasing decisions. 📈🏷️
